/**
 * Optional bridge for Scholar's replacement book screens.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately mixed into vanilla {@code Screen} rather than into a Scholar
 * class. Scholar's screens are ordinary {@code Screen}s, so this hook brackets
 * their render exactly the same way, while every Scholar-specific lookup stays
 * in {@link ScholarBookBridge} behind reflection. Nothing here needs Scholar on
 * the compile classpath, and no injector can fail against a Scholar update.</p>
 *
 * <p>Applied only when Scholar is installed; see {@code SimpleTranslateMixinPlugin}.</p>
